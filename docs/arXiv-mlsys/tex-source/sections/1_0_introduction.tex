\section{Introduction}

There has been growing research on LLM inference optimization.
In particular, recent work~\cite{liu2025optimizingllmqueriesrelational, cheng2025letbarbariansinai}
presents solutions to optimize relational data analytics workloads for offline LLM inference.
It proposes Greedy Group Recursion (GGR), an approximate algorithm that leverages
functional dependencies (such as primary and foreign key relationships from the data
schema) and table statistics, which are readily available in many databases and
analytics systems, to reduce the search space.

The GGR algorithm is described in detail in~\cite{liu2025optimizingllmqueriesrelational}.
Let us recup briefly its main points.

The pseudocode specification of GGR is in Algorithm~\ref{alg:greedy}
and is taken from the original paper but with several critical corrections (and multiple little typo fixes).
